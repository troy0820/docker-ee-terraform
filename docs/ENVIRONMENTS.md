# Platforms

- Remote State
- Docker-EE-Beta

## Remote State

This platform/environment will be what holds the state of the environment we wish to provision later.  This will have to be done before any other environment is set up.

## Docker EE Beta

This platform/environment is what will be used to provision the environment with Docker Enterprise Edition.  Docker Enterprise Edition will be set up but the nodes will not connect to each other until you manually ssh into the node.
